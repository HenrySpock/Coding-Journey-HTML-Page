        <h1>The initial statement of "Hello World"</h1>
        <h6>is a pretty small first step.</h6><br>
        <h6>Below, when I mention "tags", I'm implying <>, but I don't use them so as not to confuse the code.</h6>
            <p>For instance, in a simple sentence, just knowing <b>bold</b></p>
            <p>and <i>italic</i> requires two additional tags, b and i,</p>
            <p>which in fact can be written as strong or em, respectively.</p>
            <p>The line space you see below? A br tag.</p><br>
            <p>The above statements occur as "nested elements" in the code -</p>
            <p>the bold and italic tags are nested inside p tags, which are</p>
            <p>inside body tags and further inside html tags.</p>
            <p>Even the ability to put a blank line between statements requires and additional tag.</p>
<!-- The handout lists the required tags under My Second Example, but this is still the first.-->
            <p>The list of required tags is shown on an example called "My Second Page,"</p>
            <p>but I'm keeping it all on the first page for now.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, the line below is an example of an hr break.</p><hr><br>
        <h1>HEADERS</h1>
        <h1>Now</h1>
        <h2>let's</h2>
        <h3>see</h3>
        <h4>h1</h4>
        <h5>through</h5>
        <h6>h6.</h6>
        <p>Here is the p tag paragraph text for comparison.</p>
        <p><small>And here is a sample of p tag paragraph text with an additional small tag.</small></p>
        <p>Here is something fun, a<sup>supertext</sup>.</p>
        <p>And its companion, the<sub>subtext</sub>.</p>
        <p>And if I had something inspiring to say to close out this section:</p>
        <blockquote><em>I would use a blockquote tag, possibly italicized.</em></blockquote><hr><br>

        <h1>And here we see a basic layout of Main Title</h1>
            <h2>With a Section title,</h2>
                    <p>followed by section text.</p>
                <h3>A Sub-section header would be larger than the content but not the section title.</h3>
                    <p>And here is the sub-section,</p>
                <h3>with another sub-section header here,</h3>
            <h2>and a new section heading here, as large as the first section header.</h2><hr><br>
        <h3>Perhaps we should look at a couple lists.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This list of text</li>
                <li>is unordered,</li>
                <li>and thus bulleted.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Whereas this list of text</li>
                <li>is ordered,</li>
                <li>hence numbered.</li>
            </ol><br>
        <h3>Now let's have a look at links.</h3>
            <p>These could be within a page on a website, to another page on the same website,</p>
            <p>or to any website you have the address to reach.</p>
            <p>Links use the "a href" tag.</p>
            <p>For instance, clicking <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5600249/" target="_blank">here</a> opens a tab to a new, magical place.</p>
            <p>The above a href tag uses a target="_blank" attribute - without this,</p>
            <p>it would open the link in the current tab, and you'd need your back button to return here.</p>
            <p>The a href tag itself is an attribute, for that matter.</p>
